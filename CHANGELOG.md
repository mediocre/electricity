## [3.1.0] - 2022-03-18
### Changed

## [3.0.0] - 2021-11-17
### Changed
- Version 3.0.0 is a complete rewrite designed to improve application startup times by lazily processing files as they are requested (instead of eagerly processing all files at application start).
- Because files are processed lazily as they are requested, many users should experience reduced memory footprints for their apps.
- We dropped support for the `If-Modified-Since` HTTP header due to the complexities in calculating this accurately for Snockets and SASS dependency graphs. The ETag HTTP header is still supported.
- In v2.9.0 we replaced `react-tools` with `@babel/preset-react`. You can now pass along options to babel.
- When using a CDN hostname we always return absolute URLs with the https:// origin (instead of protocol-relative URLs since this is now an anti-pattern: https://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/).
- We no longer GZip content that is less than 1500 bytes (the size of a single TCP packet).

## [2.9.0] - 2021-11-02
### Changed
- Replaced `react-tools` with `@babel/preset-react`.

## [2.8.0] - 2021-05-04
### Changed
- Replaced `uglify-es` with `uglify-js`.
